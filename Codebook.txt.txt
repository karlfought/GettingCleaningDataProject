The following document describes the data that is a result of the summary analysis of the Samsung data. For information on how the data was processed see the ReadMe.md file contained in this repository. 

The raw data for this analysis was obtained from the following URL and details about the methodologies used to collect the data can be found in the files README.txt and features_info.txt located in the UCI HAR Dataset folder of the extracted raw data zip file.

Included in the summarisedfinaldata.txt file is a summarised data set aggregated by Subject and Activity. The activities included in the dataset are WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING. The Subjects are identified by ID only. 

The full set of data points are listed below however the following is an explanation of the naming of variables. Each of the values is the mean average of the measure by Subject and by Activity as indicated by the prepended average to each variable name.  Where the average is followed by time in the vairable, the measurement is a time domain frequency  and where average is followed by frequency is indicative of the fact that the measurement is a frequency domain and a  Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied. The sensor the measurement comes from is indicated by either Accelerometer or Gyroscope. Body and Gravity in the name of the variable indicate which frequency was read from the Accelerometer. For each of the metrics, the Mean and Standard Deviation metrics were averaged and which is indicated in the name. Finally the axis that was read is appended to the end of each variable name.
